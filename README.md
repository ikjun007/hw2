# hw2
I updated website that I created last week for hw1, adding more stylings using the Tailwind CSS framework.
I added Tailwind CSS frame work by adding the installment line in the header part.
Using that, I modified the website in many parts such as colors, typography, borders, sizing, box model, flexbox, and responsive design.
Also, I added a form (name, email, and the date you want to book). I connected this website to Netlify. My live site address is https://johnkimhw2.netlify.app
